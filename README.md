GuidedTesting
=============

Testing and analysis of web applications project (2013)

Guided Testing Project is used to guide the users with some test cases so that the User could include them in the current test suite and observe an increase the code coverage.
Here a bookstore application is used for testing purpose.
(CFG)Control flow graph is used to represent the binary code as nodes and the flow of the code as links between those nodes. (This is done using bcel.jar)

Cobertura tool is used to generate the coverage report of the application.

Using CFG we can find out the uncovered nodes for a servlet file and hence work out an algorithm to cover those so as to improve the code coverage.

Login.jsp is used as an example servlet file.
Coverage was sucessfully increased by 4%.
